# USCG-Emissions
Data journalism project exploring patterns of toxic substance spills using public data from the United States Coast Guard National Response Center [website](www.nrc.uscg.mil/). Focusing on Louisiana issues for the [Polluter's Paradise series](https://www.propublica.org/series/polluters-paradise), a collaboration between ProPublica, The Times-Picayune and The Advocate.

File overview:
Files labeled *CY--.xlsx* : were downloaded from the National Response Center database. The number represents the year, so CY01.xlsx is the NRC data file for spills reported to the Coast Guard in 2001.  
Files labeled *CY--.csv* : were saved from corresponding .xslx files into separate sheets containing info on the calls received, incident basics (commons), incident details, and materials involved.  
Files labeled *CY--.R* : code to combine and sort the .csv sheets for each year, then group by variables of interest, in this case *crude oil* spills into *water* in *Louisiana.*  


Analysis methods: So far, datasets from 2008 to 2018 have been combined by state and type of spills and visualized to estimate relative contribution of different states to nationwide spills called in to the USCG emissions line.
